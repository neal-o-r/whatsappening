#Sentiment analysis on Whastapp messages

This code does sentiment analysis on my Whatsapp messages to classify them as 'Positive', 'Negative', or 'Neutral'. Find out how Positive or otherwise you are! There are two methods here, a simple Naive Bayes Classifier, and the out of the box NLTK Vader classifier. The Naive Bayes algorithm is trained on a set of hand-classified tweets (which you can find [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crwong/cs224u-project/master/data/sentiment/training.1600000.processed.noemoticon.csv)).
