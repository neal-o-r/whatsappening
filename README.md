#Sentiment analysis on Whastapp messages

This is a Naive Bayesian Classifier to classify Whatsapp messages as 'Positive', 'Negative', or 'Neutral'. Find out how Positive or otherwise you are! The algorithm is trained on a set of hand-classified tweets (which you can find [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crwong/cs224u-project/master/data/sentiment/training.1600000.processed.noemoticon.csv)), and can then be applied to a set of Whatsapp messages (you'll have to supply your own).
